  description: |
    This system extension provides the necessary kernel module drivers for ceph under rook-ceph. 
    These drivers are necessary to have a fully functioning rook-ceph or ceph setup.
    You will almost certainly require all of the extensions with the exception of LVM if you
    are not encrypting your devices.
